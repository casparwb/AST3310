abstract = {We report a comprehensive light-element (Li, C, N, O, Na, Mg, and Al) abundance analysis of three solar-type main sequence (MS) dwarfs and three red giant branch (RGB) clump stars in the Hyades open cluster using high-resolution and high signal-to-noise spectroscopy. The abundances have been derived in a self-consistent fashion, and for each group (MS or RGB), the CNO abundances are found to be in excellent star-to-star agreement. Using the dwarfs to infer the initial composition of the giants, the combined abundance patterns confirm that the giants have undergone the first dredge-up and that material processed by the CN cycle has been mixed to the surface layers. The observed abundances are compared to predictions of a standard stellar model based on the Clemson-American University of Beirut (CAUB) stellar evolution code. The model reproduces the observed evolution of the N and O abundances, as well as the previously derived 12C/13C ratio, but it fails to predict by a factor of 1.5 the observed level of 12C depletion. A similar discord appears to exist in previously reported observed and modeled C abundances of giants in the Galactic disk. Random uncertainties in the mean abundances and uncertainties related to possible systematic errors in the Hyades dwarf and giant parameter scales cannot account for the discrepancy in the observed and modeled abundances. Li abundances are derived to determine if noncanonical extra mixing, like that seen in low-mass metal-poor giants, has occurred in the Hyades giants. The Li abundance of the giant $\gamma$ Tau is in good accord with the predicted level of surface Li dilution, but a 0.35 dex spread in the giant Li abundances is found and cannot be explained by the stellar model. Possible sources of the spread are discussed; however, it is apparent that the differential mechanism responsible for the Li dispersion must be unrelated to the uniformly low 12C abundances of the giants. Na, Mg, and Al abundances are derived as an additional test of our stellar model. All three elements are found to be overabundant by 0.2-0.5 dex in the giants relative to the dwarfs. Such large enhancements of these elements are not predicted by the stellar model, and non-LTE effects significantly larger (and, in some cases, of opposite sign) than those implied by extant literature calculations are the most likely cause. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {This paper is the second part of the new evaluation of atomic masses, AME2016. Using least-squares adjustments to all evaluated and accepted experimental data, described in Part I, we derive tables with numerical values and graphs to replace those given in AME2012. The first table lists the recommended atomic mass values and their uncertainties. It is followed by a table of the influences of data on primary nuclides, a table of various reaction and decay energies, and finally, a series of graphs of separation and decay energies. The last section of this paper lists all references of the input data used in the AME2016 and the NUBASE2016 evaluations (first paper in this issue).},
